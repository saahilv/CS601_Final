# Project information: 
I have created a website about me that has 6 different pages:

1) Home page: This page has a brief overview and a photo about myself and also carries navigation to all other pages. It has a moving button that links the website to my wqorkplace and also has a table for Frequently asked questions. 

2) Vashishta Family: This page has details about the members of my family and has images and videos of everyone. It also has a navigation window at the top which connects it to the other html files. It has brief summaries of everyone in the Vashishta family.

3) Locations: In addition to the navigation pane at the top, this page has a small map of my journey from New Delhi to Seattle and lists out all the places that I have lived in for short and long durations.

4) Leave your Mark: This is an interaction web form, (also has a navigation pane at the top) initially I had decided to use a database but due to integration issues, I decided to just use dynamic API that autofills the city and country name based on the zip code. The web form clears out and refreshes after submission but unfortunately it doesn;t have a visitors log. That is something I can incorporate once I am more familiar with online database applications.

5) Resume: This page showcases a copy of my resume and the ability to download it in addition to a navigation page at the  very top.

6) Hobby Lobby: This page utilizes CSS flexbox and grid as well as vue js to show pictures of what I enjoy doing. Hovering over pictures also creates text overlays explaining what I am doing in the pictures. I decided to go with black and white pictures for the aesthetic. Lastly, this page also has a navigation page at the top.
